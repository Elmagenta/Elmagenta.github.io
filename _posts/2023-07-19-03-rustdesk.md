Rustdesk docker compose "All-In-One".
Why?
Because in this situation I put both of the needed container in one compose, you can separate them but you will need both up if you want to self host rustdesk so in this case I preferred to pu them together.
Another reason of the "All-In-One" is that they share the same data folder, so if you need the encryption you don't need to copy the key from the `id_<number>.pub` of hbbs to the `id_<number>` of hhbr but it's already done by sharing the same folder.

```yaml
version: '3'

networks:
  rustdesk-net:
    external: false

services:
  hbbs:
    container_name: hbbs
    ports:
      - 21115:21115
      - 21116:21116
      - 21116:21116/udp
      - 21118:21118
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbs -r <YOUR_IP_OR_HOST>:21117
    volumes:
      - ./data:/root
    networks:
      - rustdesk-net
    depends_on:
      - hbbr
    restart: unless-stopped

  hbbr:
    container_name: hbbr
    ports:
      - 21117:21117
      - 21119:21119
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbr
    volumes:
      - ./data:/root
    networks:
      - rustdesk-net
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Encryption 
If you use this container as it is the direct connection between two systems will not be encrypted (you can see this by watching in the top left corner when you are connected to a remote machine).

To do so you need two things:
1. Change `command: hbbs -r <YOUR_IP_OR_HOST>:21117` into `command: hbbs -r <YOUR_IP_OR_HOST>:21117 -k _` and change `command: hbbr` into `command: hbbr -k _`
2. Put the key on Rustdesk settings
    1. Go to the `data` folder
    2. Open the file `id_<number>.pub` and copy the string
    3. Paste the string on the settings (see the image below)
