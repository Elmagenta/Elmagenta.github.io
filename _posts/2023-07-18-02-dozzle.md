Very easy docker compose to set up Dozzle, a tool that can let you read the logs of others containers, I found it useful instead of login into ssh and see logs from docker command.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  dozzle:
    container_name: dozzle
    image: amir20/dozzle:v4.10.19
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - 9999:8080 # You can change '9999' with a port of your liking 
```
